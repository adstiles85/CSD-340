        <p class="intro">
            My name is Andrew Stiles, and I grew up in Elkhorn, Nebraska. It is a suburb of Omaha. I have lived in Omaha, NE, Los Angeles, CA, Kansas City, MO, and Kearney, NE. 
            I have always had a passion for technology. 
            <span class="sentence">This has lead me to pursue higher education in IT.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            My favorite hobbies are playing video games, watching movies, listening to audio books, and travelling. I enjoy seeing and learning about new places, both real and imaginitive.
        </p>

        <p>
            I currently live in Omaha, NE, where I attend Bellevue University. I'm pursuing a degree in Software Development and hope to become a back-end developer.

            Family is very important to me, and I enjoy spending weekends with my wife and children. We often have game nights or cook meals together. I have 6 sons, and they keep me pretty busy.
